          <h3>Reading and Writing Skills</h3>
          <div class="card-content">
            Reading and writing teaches essential skills for understanding, analyzing, 
            and producing various types of texts, focusing on critical thinking, different 
            writing patterns (narration, description, persuasion, etc.), organizing information 
            using tools like graphic organizers, and connecting reading to writing for academic 
            and professional success. It bridges decoding and comprehension with written expression, 
            showing how reading informs writing and vice versa. </div>

          <h3>Statistics and Probability</h3>
          <div class="card-content" class="highlight">
            Statistics and Probability is a core mathematics subject dealing with collecting, 
            analyzing, interpreting, and displaying data (Statistics) and the study of chance 
            and likelihood of events (Probability), forming a crucial tool for decision-making, 
            modeling uncertainty, and understanding patterns in science, finance, and daily life, 
            covering topics from random variables and distributions to hypothesis testing and regression. 
            It teaches how to reason from samples to populations (Statistics) and populations to samples 
            (Probability) using concepts like normal distribution, sampling, and correlation. </div>

        <div class="card">
          <h3>Basic Calculus</h3>
          <div class="card-content">
            Basic Calculus is the study of continuous change, built on the foundation of limits, 
            and divided into two main branches: Differential Calculus (rates of change, slopes, derivatives) 
            and Integral Calculus (accumulation, areas, integrals), linked by the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, 
            essential for science, engineering, and economics. Key topics include limits, continuity, differentiation rules, 
            integration techniques, and applications like optimization</div>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
          <h3>Practical Research</h3>
          <div class="card-content">
            Practical Research teach critical thinking and problem-solving through hands-on research, 
            focusing on understanding phenomena (PR1) and testing hypotheses (PR2) for real-world 
            application, moving from inquiry to investigation and immersion. </div>
